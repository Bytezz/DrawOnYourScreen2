/*
 * Except for the font, you don't need to restart the extension.
 * Just save this file as ~/.local/share/drawOnYourScreen/user.css and the changes will be applied for your next brushstroke.
 *
 * ~/.local/share/drawOnYourScreen/user.css file is automatically generated by activating "Edit style".
 * Delete ~/.local/share/drawOnYourScreen/user.css file to retrieve default drawing style.
 *
 * line-join (no string):
 * 0 : miter, 1 : round, 2 : bevel
 * line-cap (no string):
 * 0 : butt, 1 : round, 2 : square
 *
 * dash:
 * dash-array-on is the length of dashes (no dashes if 0, you can put 0.1 to get dots or square according to line-cap).
 * dash-array-off is the length of gaps (no dashes if 0).
 *
 * square area:
 * Drawing in a square area is convenient when using the extension as a vector graphics editor. By default,
 * when toggling 'Square drawing area', the area is sized to 75% of monitor size. You can fix and customize this size
 * by uncommenting square-area-width and square-area-height lines.
 *
 * font:
 * Only one family : no comma separated list of families like "font1, font2, ..., Sans-Serif".
 * Font family can be any font installed, or a generic family name (Serif, Sans-Serif, Monospace, Cursive, Fantasy).
 * Font weight and font style : no upper case when string.
 * Weight <= 500 (or lighter, normal, medium) is rendered as normal.
 * Weight > 500 (or bolder, bold) is rendered as bold.
 * Oblique and italic style supports depend on the font family and seem to be rendered identically.
