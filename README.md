## Details

* Screenshot Tool extension:

 [Screenshot Tool](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1112/screenshot-tool/) is a convenient extension to “create, copy, store and upload screenshots”. To use it while drawing mode is active, toggle the area selection mode thanks to the Screenshot Tool shortcut (`Super + F11` by default, see its preferences) and **hold** the `space` key when selecting the area with pointer to avoid drawing.
